* * *\
##Basic starter templates for SUIT CSS inspired SASS projects.\
\
Only the necessities: \
- SASS\
- customizable inline-block grid \
- typographical hierarchy\
- FontAwesome\
- 7 included stock images *via (Startup Stock Photos)[http://startupstockphotos.com]*\
\
Plus two favorites:\
- (Skrollr)[{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://github.com/Prinzhorn/skrollr"}}{\fldrslt https://github.com/Prinzhorn/skrollr}}] parallax library\
- the super-neat (ScrollReveal)[{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://github.com/julianlloyd/scrollReveal.js"}}{\fldrslt https://github.com/julianlloyd/scrollReveal.js}}] library\
\
###SASS\
It\'92s the best. Be smart, use it for variables, calc(), etc, but keep the nesting and functions to a minimum. Ain\'92t nobody got time for that.\
\
###Inline Block Grid\
Columns are silly. Starbucks keeps it simple and uses easy to understand nomenclature. That\'92s not silly. Adjust settings in ```~/components/_grid--settings.scss```, including breakpoints.\
\
\
And that\'92s it. Think you can make it better? I\'92m sure you can. Fork me. I\'92d love to learn something new.}
