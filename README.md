# SVBSTRATE
My base templates for developing sites. Base styles, easy peasy grid framework (inline-block *and* float based), and some useful things like a nice typographic scale, variables and low-level mixins.

*These templates will be updated much more frequently than they have been in the past, since I only recently made development my full time job. How exciting!*
