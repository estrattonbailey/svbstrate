SVBSTRATE
=========

Basic starter templates for SUIT CSS inspired SASS projects.
---

Only the necessities:
- SASS
- customizable inline-block grid
- typographical hierarchy
- FontAwesome
- 7 included stock images *via (Startup Stock Photos)[http://startupstockphotos.com]*

Plus two favorites:
- (Skrollr)["https://github.com/Prinzhorn/skrollr"]
- the super-neat (ScrollReveal)["https://github.com/julianlloyd/scrollReveal.js"]

###SASS
It's the best. Be smart, use it for variables, calc(), etc, but keep the nesting and functions to a minimum. Ain't nobody got time for that.

###Inline Block Grid
Columns are silly. Starbucks keeps it simple and uses easy to understand syntax. That's smart. Adjust settings in ```~/components/_grid--settings.scss```, including breakpoints.

And that's it. Think you can make it better? I'm sure you can. Fork me. I'd love to learn something new.
