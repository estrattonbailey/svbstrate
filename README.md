# SVBSTRATE
My sandbox templates. A framework of sorts.

See [BASSCSS](https://github.com/basscss/basscss) and [Tachyons](https://github.com/mrmrs/tachyons) to learn more. All code herein are a product of their writings and codebases, I just wanted to do it a little differently.

### Notes 6/21
Total file size is an issue right now (~53kb minified). The bulk comes from the margin and padding classes generated by `base/_padding.scss` and `base/_margins.scss`, and of course the grid widths. The spacing partials can easily be trimmed down by specifying fewer stop-gaps/directions. And the grid *should definitely* be customized for every project i.e. if you only have two-up and four-up grids, you only need to enable classes `.s1, .s12, .s14`. This dramatically reduces file size.

## A few resources:
If you think this is all nonsense. I'm still not convinced it's not.

### [About HTML semantics and front-end architecture](http://nicolasgallagher.com/about-html-semantics-front-end-architecture/)
Read this first if you haven't already.

### [What Classes are For](http://xn--h4hg.ws/2015/05/14/what-are-classes-for/)
[@mrmrs](https://github.com/mrmrs) I love how far this guy goes into the theory of front-end.

### [Rethinking Variables in CSS](http://jxnblk.com/writing/posts/rethinking-variables-in-css/)
[@jxblk](https://github.com/jxnblk) has some really great writings in this area of front-end architecture.

### [Immutable CSS](http://csswizardry.com/2015/03/immutable-css/) and the [BEM syntax](http://csswizardry.com/2013/01/mindbemding-getting-your-head-round-bem-syntax/)
Both from CSS Wizardry. I think adhering, at least in part, to these ideas is going to be really important moving forward in front-end dev.
